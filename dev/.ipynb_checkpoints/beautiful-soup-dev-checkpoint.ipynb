Attendees will learn how to identify potential problems whether they be thermal hazards or selectivity issues. Methods used by other companies for handling hazardous reagents and reactions will be described as well as alternative chemistry to circumvent these reactions and/or reagents.\n",

Sources of safety information in the literature and via the internet will be provided. The course provides lists of reagents and functional groups that should trigger safety testing studies.
