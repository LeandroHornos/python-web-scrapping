      "COURSE OUTLINE: The aim of the course is to give lab chemists an understanding of the issues that need to be considered during the early stages of scale up to large laboratory scale equipment (10-20 litre vessels) / kilo lab. The course will concentrate on chemical safety and selectivity issues and include information on what safety testing equipment is available and the uses and limitations of this equipment. Attendees will learn how to identify potential problems whether they be thermal hazards or selectivity issues. Methods used by other companies for handling hazardous reagents and reactions will be described as well as alternative chemistry to circumvent these reactions and/or reagents. BENEFITS OF ATTENDING: Attendees will learn how to identify potentially unsafe chemical processes, particularly those that pose more a danger on scale. They will learn about what testing procedures are available to help them identify unsafe operating conditions to enable to talk knowledgably to in-house safety professionals or contract organizations. Sources of safety information in the literature and via the internet will be provided. The course provides lists of reagents and functional groups that should trigger safety testing studies. Methods used in other companies for handling hazardous reagents and reactions will be provided. Alternatives reagents or substitutes for hazardous materials will also be discussed. Recommendations will be provided for making the first sample of a product where there may be safety or stability concern WHO SHOULD ATTEND: Any laboratory chemist involved in the scale-up to large scale equipment/kilo lab WHAT'S INCLUDED: he course fee includes:Link to watch all four live sessions. Electronic version of the course manual*Course certificate. For this on line course, there will be no recordings available and *the e reader manual is NOT printable or downloadable (due to copyright).  If you prefer a hard copy of the manual you will have the opportunity of purchasing a professionally printed hard copy during the booking process.\n",

      "This ONLINE short course is split into 3 modules and part of the well-received “Chemical Engineering: What Scientists and Other Disciplines Need to Know” course. You can have the choice to attend one, two or all three modules.  This module is set to take place on  Friday May 13th at 2.00pm – 5.00pm BST (British Summer Time)   If you are also interested in the full Introduction to Chemical Engineering Science, click here for more details.  These modules have been developed, and are presented, by chemical engineers and chemists who specialise in facilitating knowledge transfer and understanding between different scientific and engineering disciplines working at the R&D-manufacturing interface. They do not dwell on the derivation of mathematical formulae or equations used in chemical engineering design, but instead focuses on what other disciplines need to know about the information and data that chemical engineers require for design, scale-up and process troubleshooting. Chemical engineering without mathematics is impossible, but only relevant mathematics is presented at a level that should not trouble anyone with a numerate scientific degree.   Other disciplines do not need to know how to design plants or equipment and the modules do not attempt to teach this. They focus on understanding chemical engineering principles to promote clear communication between disciplines, facilitating information and knowledge transfer. If you are interested in the other two modules, please click on the dates below, along with the Introduction to Chemical Engineering.  Please note there is a special discount if you attend the full course and all three modules.

      "COURSE OUTLINE: To train chemists and engineers in efficient methods for developing safe, low cost, robust chemical processes in the minimum amount of time. To improve the awareness of chemists on the principles of scale-up and development, in chemical engineering concepts relating to safe plant operation and in the latest techniques for the optimisation of processes. To learn from the experience (and mistakes) of others by examining case studies from industry. The first two days of the course outline the fundamental science of exothermic reaction hazards and thermal stability and introduces methodologies available to qualify and quantify relevant parameters.

      "Developing safe processes is of paramount importance to any chemical company. Exothermic chemical reactions in batch and semi- batch processes can result in serious injury to people and plant if they get out of control. Results of thermal runaways include violent loss of containment, possibly explosion and the release of flammable or toxic materials to the environment. Employers are bound by Health & Safety legislation to ensure the safety of their employees and those outside their employment who might be affected by their activities. Chemical manufacturers must therefore be aware of all potential dangers in their processes and take steps to eliminate them. The best approach is to design safety into the process from the start. Often, the first sign of loss of control over a reaction is a reduction in yield or in the quality of the product. Thus safety, quality and profitability are all interlinked. The fourth and fifth day of the course focuses on plant protection and safety systems designed to prevent or protect against runaway reaction scenarios. This includes extensive discussion and workshops on process control strategies and emergency relief system design for two-phase relief using DIERS methodology. The course makes extensive use of case studies to help embed principles and key learning points such that attendees leave with tools they can immediately deploy. This seminar is designed to enhance the awareness of chemists and engineers regarding hazard issues. Utilising the expertise of the chemists and chemical engineers at DEKRA and Scientific Update, it will consider hazard control of new chemical processes throughout their development cycle: from early development through to full-scale production. Hazards can often be eliminated by appropriate choice of reagent or synthetic route at the R&D stage. Where this is not possible, techniques exist to quantify the hazards so that robust engineering solutions can he applied in production.\n",

      "We are delighted to be able to offer this course now ONLINE, this two-day course will be divided up into four sessions using an online platform, dates and times are as follows and set in BST (British Summer Time): Tuesday May 3rd | 2.00pm – 5.00pm BST Wednesday May 4th| 2.00pm – 5.00pm BST Thursday May 5th | 2.00pm – 5.00pm BST Friday May 6th | 2.00pm – 5.00pm BST The safety of chemical processes is critical for the whole chemical industry. It is vital that process development chemists and engineers are able to identify aspects of the chemistry that may be hazardous or pose a risk to the safety of the process or equipment. In order to do this, they need to know when to proactively engage colleagues or contractors to carry out process safety testing and hazard analysis, which in turn requires a knowledge of the equipment and test methods available. As chemical reactions are scaled up and operations become more economic the ability to remove heat from exothermic events becomes reduced and at the same time the outcome of any incident becomes much more severe. This is an almost unique course on the safety of chemical reactions and processes that are designed by chemists for chemists (and engineers) with the ultimate aim of helping the chemical industry reduce the number of chemical or process related incidents.\n",
