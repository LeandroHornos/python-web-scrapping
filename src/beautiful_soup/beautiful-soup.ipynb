      "Course Outline\n",
      "The aim of the course is to give lab chemists an understanding of the issues that need to be considered during the early stages of scale up to large laboratory scale equipment (10-20 litre vessels) / kilo lab. The course will concentrate on chemical safety and selectivity issues and include information on what safety testing equipment is available and the uses and limitations of this equipment. Attendees will learn how to identify potential problems whether they be thermal hazards or selectivity issues. Methods used by other companies for handling hazardous reagents and reactions will be described as well as alternative chemistry to circumvent these reactions and/or reagents.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Benefits of Attending\n",
      "Attendees will learn how to identify potentially unsafe chemical processes, particularly those that pose more a danger on scale. They will learn about what testing procedures are available to help them identify unsafe operating conditions to enable to talk knowledgably to in-house safety professionals or contract organizations. Sources of safety information in the literature and via the internet will be provided. The course provides lists of reagents and functional groups that should trigger safety testing studies. Methods used in other companies for handling hazardous reagents and reactions will be provided. Alternatives reagents or substitutes for hazardous materials will also be discussed. Recommendations will be provided for making the first sample of a product where there may be safety or stability concern.  \n",
